<p>1、All that is beautiful poems and passages of life things do not change;we change.sell your clothes and keep your thoughts.</p>
<p>2、Don’t wait to be lonely, to recognize the value of a friend.</p>
<p>3、I sit at my window this morning where the world like a passer-by stops for a moment， nods to me and goes. </p>
